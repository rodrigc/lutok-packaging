Package: liblutok
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: lightweight C++ API for Lua
 This package contains the Lutok library.
 .
 Lutok provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API to ease the
 interaction between C++ and Lua.  These wrappers make intensive use of
 Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) to prevent resource
 leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report
 errors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always
 left untouched in the face of errors.  The library also provides a small
 subset of miscellaneous utility functions built on top of the wrappers.
 Lutok focuses on providing a clean and safe C++ interface; the drawback
 is that it is not suitable for performance-critical environments.  In
 order to implement error-safe C++ wrappers on top of a Lua C binary
 library, Lutok adds several layers or abstraction and error checking
 that go against the original spirit of the Lua C API and thus degrade
 performance.
